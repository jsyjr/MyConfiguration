;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package consists of functions to replace
;; `locate-library' and `load-library' with interactive
;; versions that do minibuffer completion.
;;
;; entry points:
;;   ilocate-library :
;;      locate library in load-path
;;   ilocate-library-find-source :
;;      locate library, and read the source (.el),
;;      if it's available, into a new buffer in
;;      the other window
;;   ilocate-load-library :
;;      interactive load-library with completion
;;
;; All functions use a cached table of libraries found in the
;; `load-path'.  The table, `ilocate-library-cache', is
;; generated the first time any of these functions are
;; called, or if the `load-path' has changed since the last
;; invocation of the function.  You may force the refreshing
;; of the cache by calling any of the functions with a
;; prefix arg.
;;

;;; History:
;;
;; created by Mike Slass <miknrene@drizzle.com>
;; version 0.6 9/12/2001
;;   - fix completing-read-library to handle non-existant directories
;;        in the load-path
;;
;; modified by Klaus Berndl <klaus.berndl@sdm.de>
;; version 0.7 30/07/2002
;;   - added a library cache with lazy instantiation. See
;;     `ilocate-library-cache'.
;;
;;
;; version 0.8 July 30, 2002 - Mike Slass
;;    - incorporated Klaus Berndl's changes (see above)
;;    - modified all the ilocate-... interactive functions
;;      to accept only one (optional) argument, a prefix arg.
;;      With prefix arg, all now force a refresh of
;;      `ilocate-library-cache'
;;    - modified completing-read-library to accept an
;;      optional third argument, reload-cache, to force the
;;      refresh
;;    - added "Building libraries list ..." message to
;;      `ilocate-get-all-libs'

;;    - clean up the doc strings
;;
;;
;; version 0.9 31/07/2002
;; modified by Klaus Berndl <klaus.berndl@sdm.de>
;;
;;   - added a mechanism which detects changes of last
;;     library-search-path (so also for `load-path' for
;;     example) and then rebuilds auto. the
;;     `ilocate-library-cache'. See
;;     `ilocate-last-search-path-cache'.
;;
;; modified by Mike Slass
;;    - incorporated changes and suggestions from
;;      Jens Schmidt <Jens.Schmidt@oracle.com>:
;;        * clean up docs
;;        * fix a bug in ilocate-library-find-souce
;;        * renamed symbols to all have ilocate prefix:
;;          completing-read-library ==>
;;            ilocate-completing-read-library
;;          iload-library ==>
;;            ilocate-load-library
;;  - deleted iupdate-library-cache
;;
;;
;; version 0.9.1 09/03/2002 - update maintainer address
